# Copy Excel tables into new master table

This project shows how to combine data that resides in Excel tables into a new master table with all rows included. It creates a new worksheet and combines all rows into a single table. 

There are two variations of this script 
1. First script combines all tables in the Excel file. It assumes that all tables in the Excel files have same structure. 
1. Second script that selectively gets tables within a set of worksheets. It assumes that all the tables in those select worksheets have the same structure.
